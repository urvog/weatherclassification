# Weather Image Classification withÂ Keras

Weather phenomenon recognition notably affects many aspects of our daily lives, for example, weather forecast, road condition monitoring, transportation, agriculture, forestry management, and the detection of the natural environment. In contrast, few studies aim to classify actual weather phenomenon images, usually relying on visual observations from humans.

In this project we propose a study weather classification from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Keras+Tensorflow. We present a dataset with 3348 images with six weather conditions (rain, shine, sunrise, fogsmog, snow, cloudy) obtaining a precision of 90% in the test data. Realizing the automatic and high-quality classification of weather phenomena images can provide a reference for future research on weather image classification and weather forecasting.
